# Debloat TCL Android TV

TCL Android TVs are great value, but they often come with a lot of pre-installed bloatware that can significantly affect performance. This script helps you remove unwanted apps (bloatware) to improve the TV's responsiveness.

> **⚠️ Warning Use at your own risk**. 

> Removing certain system apps may cause unexpected issues or make the TV unstable.  You are responsible for any issues caused by running this script.

---

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure that you:
1. **Know how to use ADB**.  
   If you're unfamiliar with ADB, make sure you set it up and know how to use it.
2. **Have ADB installed** on your computer.  
   Ensure that your TV and PC are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.

---

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:

	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/chrissy-dev/debloat-tlc-android-tv
	cd debloat-tlc-android-tv
	```

2. **Make the script executable**:

	```bash
	chmod +x debloat.sh
	```

3. **Run the script with the TV’s IP address as an argument**:

	```bash
	./debloat.sh <TV_IP_ADDRESS>
	```

4. **The script will connect to your TV, inform you about the process, and remove bloatware.**  

	It will also reboot the TV to apply the changes.

---

## What the Script Does

1. **Connects to the TV**:  
   The script uses ADB over the network, requiring the TV’s IP address. If no IP address is provided, the script will exit and show usage instructions.

2. **Informs the User**:  
   The script provides feedback on each step, such as connecting to the TV, removing apps, and rebooting the device.

3. **Uninstalls Bloatware**:  
   The script iterates through a list of predefined apps and removes them using ADB commands. For each app, the script will notify you whether it was successfully removed or failed.

4. **Reboots the TV**:  
   After all apps are removed, the script reboots your TV to ensure that the changes take effect.

---

## Script Overview

### 1. **Check for ADB**  
   The script checks if ADB is installed on your system. If not, it exits and prompts you to install ADB.

### 2. **Connect to the TV**  
   The script uses the ADB `connect` command to establish a connection to the TV via its IP address.

### 3. **Debloating Process**  
   The script has a pre-defined list of TCL bloatware packages, including apps like:
   - `com.tcl.partnercustomizer`
   - `com.tcl.smartalexa`
   - `com.tcl.tvweishi`  
   ...and many more. These apps are removed one by one using the `adb shell pm uninstall` command.

### 4. **Reboot the TV**  
   Once all apps are removed, the TV is rebooted to ensure that all changes take effect.

---

## Optional Customisation

1. **Modify the App List**:  
   If you want to add or remove specific apps from the debloat list, open the script and modify the `bloat` array. Be cautious and ensure the apps you remove are not essential for TV operation.

2. **Include or Exclude Apps**:  
   You can comment or uncomment specific apps in the `bloat` array to either exclude them from removal or include additional unwanted apps.

## Troubleshooting

- **ADB Connection Issues**:  
  If you’re unable to connect to your TV, ensure that your TV’s IP address is correct and that ADB debugging is enabled in your TV’s settings.
  
- **Failed App Removals**:  
  If an app fails to remove, check the error message for more details. Some apps might be protected by the system, and removal could require advanced steps.
